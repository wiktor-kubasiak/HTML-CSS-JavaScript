		<p>Dear Visitor, I would like to introduce you to the CIT's Cycle Ball Club.</p>
		<h3>What is a Cycle Ball?</h3>
		<p>It is a sport in which gameplay is similar to classic soccer, but each player rides a bicycle. This is also called a 'radball', which comes from <span id="country">Germany</span>. </p>
		<p>In a game there are two teams with two players on each one. A match lasts 40 minutes and it is divided into two 20-minute periods. </p>
		<p>Players may only move the ball with their bicycles. The feet must not touch the surface of field. Like in normal soccer the team who scored more goals wins the match. </p>
		<h3>This video represents a general idea of cycle ball: </h3>

		<h3>UCI Indoor Cycling World Championships</h3>
		<p>These are the set of world championship events for the disciplines and distances in artistic cycling and a tournament of cycle ball. They are regulated by <abbr title="Union Cycliste Internationale">UCI.</abbr> </p>
		<p>The UCI awards a gold medal and a rainbow jersey to the winner. Silver and bronze medals are awarded to the second and third place contestants. </p>
		<p>World champions wear their rainbow jersey until the following year's championship, but they are only allowed to wear it at the type of event in which they won. </p>
		<p>The jersey is predominantly white with five horizontal bands in the UCI colours around the chest. From the bottom up the colours are: green, yellow, black, red and blue. </p>
